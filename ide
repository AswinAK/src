# Q: why use unix shell as an ide?
# A1: ease of portability. New machine? Check out, type "install". Done
# A2: cause all the tools are free. Why not use free stuff?
# A3: cause some very useful stuff can be coded that way
# A4: cause its fun!
# A5: cause its empowering. New ideas? Not in the current IDE? Just add!
# A6: cause less is more. Death to code bloat!
